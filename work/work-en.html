                <h2>2023<br>Realizing Personal NFTs That Are Rentable but Non-Transferable<br>: Building a Transparent Data Management System for Medical Data Utilization</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>  
                <p>
                    In the modern medical field, the utilization of data remains underdeveloped. I focused on transforming data managed by medical institutions into "data that individuals can recognize the value of and utilize." However, this concept necessitates the construction of mechanisms that ensure both security and transparency. To date, there have been no successful cases of such implementation, leaving numerous technical and operational challenges unresolved.
                </p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    While individuals providing health checkup data wish to limit items and the duration of data sharing, insurance companies require a system that ensures data accuracy while enabling its business utilization.

                        Independently developed: <br>
                        1. Integrated previously independent technologies of rentable NFTs and non-transferable NFTs to develop NFTs that meet diverse needs.<br>
                        2. Built a VC issuance system using "Blockcerts" based on the Verifiable Credential Data Model specifications.<br>
                        3. Designed and developed a system for transferring tokens from users to data holders through the rental of health checkup data.

                <h2>2024<br>Predicting Clinical Trial Success of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors<br>: AI Utilization for Efficient and Effective Drug Development</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>  
                <p>Drug development requires over ten years and costs hundreds of billions to trillions of yen, with success probabilities declining from 1 in 15,000 a decade ago to 1 in 30,000 today. In this context, optimizing and accelerating clinical trials and resource allocation has long been a challenge for the industry. Particularly, the transition success rate from Phase II to Phase III is only 24.6%, leaving room for significant improvement.
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>We worked on predicting the success probability of Phase III clinical trials for immune checkpoint inhibitors. Applying the concept of "acquiring representations from observed information" of the world model, we visualized and verified the precision improvement using patient blood and vital data.</p>

Implementation of AI directly addressing social challenges through medical projects projected to change significantly in the next decade.</p>
