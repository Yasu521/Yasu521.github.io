                    My name, Yasuhiro (Ciao), originates from Japanese and symbolizes the process of threshing a plentiful harvest of rice. It conveys meanings of peace, health, and joy. A dedicated individual pursuing activities connected to "Healthcare" and "Happiness" since the age of 13. I engage in projects across diverse fields, including as a Data Scientist, DevOps Engineer, and Graphic Designer. I aim to be the first discoverer of possibilities by focusing on the diversity between people and things. My hobbies are playing tennis and reading books, especially novels and self-help.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Was your name an inspiration?</h3>
                <p>The inspiration came during the global outbreak of COVID-19 when I was 20 years old. My 10 years of volunteer work until university graduation also played a role. I believe the saying "A name reflects one's essence" fits perfectly.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What does health mean to you?</h3>
                <p>Health is the ability to envision how to live life and engage with things. While the WHO's definition of "A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being" is abstract, I believe it remains relevant across all times as it represents what we truly desire.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How would you spend your money if you had $10,000?</h3>
                <p>I would like to invite people who have been kind to me, prepare something delicious, and share a meal together. I have a sweet tooth and love fruits and chocolate. As for the rest, I would probably save it.</p>
