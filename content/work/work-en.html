                <h2>2023<br>Realizing NFTs tied to individuals that are rentable but non-transferable<br>: Building a system for utilizing medical data and transparent data management</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>  
                <p>In the modern medical field, the utilization of data remains a challenge. I focused on transforming the data managed by medical institutions into "data that individuals can recognize and utilize as valuable." This initiative aims to turn personal medical data into assets, fostering a future society where lives are mutually protected. However, building a system that ensures safety and transparency is essential. Blockchain technology has been noted as a promising solution to this challenge, but no successful implementations have existed, leaving numerous technical and operational issues unresolved. Moreover, tools provided by GAFA lack flexibility for diverse personalities and raise privacy concerns.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    Building a system where individuals providing health check-up data can limit items and disclosure periods while insurance companies can ensure data accuracy and utilize it for business purposes.

                        Individual development.<br>
                        1. Integrated independently developed technologies for rentable and non-transferable NFTs to meet diverse needs.<br>
                        2. Built a VC issuance system using the open-source "Blockcerts" technology based on W3C's Verifiable Credential Data Model specifications.<br>
                        3. Designed and developed a system where tokens are transferred from users to holders through the rental of health check-up data, creating a new ecosystem for utilizing the value of data.<br>

                <h2>2024<br>Predicting Clinical Trial Success of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors<br>: AI Utilization for Efficient and Effective Drug Development</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>  
                <p>Drug development requires over ten years and costs hundreds of billions to trillions of yen, with success probabilities declining from 1 in 15,000 a decade ago to 1 in 30,000 today. In this context, optimizing and accelerating clinical trials and resource allocation has long been a challenge for the industry. Particularly, the transition success rate from Phase II to Phase III is only 24.6%, leaving room for significant improvement.
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>We worked on predicting the success probability of Phase III clinical trials for immune checkpoint inhibitors. Applying the concept of "acquiring representations from observed information" of the world model, we visualized and verified the precision improvement using patient blood and vital data.</p>
